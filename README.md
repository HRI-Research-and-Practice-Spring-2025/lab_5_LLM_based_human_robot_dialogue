# lab_5_LLM_based_human_robot_dialogue

This repository contains the starter code for [Lab 5: LLM-Based Human-Robot Dialogue](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/lab_05_llm_based_hr_dialogue.html) for the University of Chicago course [CMSC 20630/30630 Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/index.html) taught by Dr. Sarah Sebo in Spring 2025. 

The learning goals for this lab are:
- Students will gain exposure to programming Misty to talk adaptively with a human participant leveraging (1) Deepgram's live transcription for speech-to-text, (2) a generative model from Gemini for robot text generation, and (3) OpenAI for the robot's text-to-speech.
- Students will learn how to prompt engineer the text generation model to enable the Misty robot to guide a human subject through the "Three Good Things" positive psychology exercise.
- Students will gain experience programming different Misty robot expressions that will enable the robot to exhibit movement and appear dynamic when conversing with people.
- Students will explore the different speech-to-text voice options available to them through the OpenAI API.
